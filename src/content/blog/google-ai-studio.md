If you've ever wanted to build your own AI-powered web app without heavy coding, **Google AI Studio** is the perfect place to start. It's a free tool by Google that lets developers and creators build chatbots, image generators, and intelligent assistants powered by **Gemini AI models** — all inside an easy-to-use interface.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to create your first AI app using **Google AI Studio**, from setup to deployment.

## Step 1: Sign In to Google AI Studio

Start by visiting **aistudio.google.com/apps**. You'll need a Google account to access the **Google AI Studio Apps Dashboard**. Once signed in, you'll see a workspace where you can build, test, and manage your AI applications in one place.

## Step 2: Create a New App

Click **"Create App"** to begin. You'll be asked to:

- Choose your **app type** (chat, image generation, translation, etc.)

This flexibility allows you to customize your AI's purpose from the very start.

Inside the editor, you can define:

- **System instructions** (the AI's personality or role)
- **Example user queries** to guide its tone and context
- **Prompt templates** like `$user_input` to dynamically handle requests

## Step 4: Test Your AI App

Use the built-in **Preview Mode** to interact with your app in real time. Try out different prompts, adjust parameters, and refine your system message until the responses feel right.

## Step 5: Export or Integrate Your App

Once your app works well, **Google AI Studio** lets you:

- Export the API endpoint
- Copy the sample code to integrate it into your own website or project
- Embed the app into other platforms

## Step 6: Deploy Your App

You can deploy your app's interface on:

- **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages** for frontend hosting
- **Google Cloud Functions** or **Firebase** for backend logic
